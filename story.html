                    <h4>I knew Randi was the perfect woman for me before I even met her.</h4>
                    <p>
                        I was living with my best friend Dan when I met Randi. I had explained in detail to him what my ideal girl would be, in all aspects. We went to a friend's house
                        one night who happened to be Randi's neighbor. I had never seen her before but as soon as she walked in the door it was obvious that she is exactly what I was looking
                        for. So obvious in fact, that even my friends knew she was perfect for me.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We started dating soon after that. Everything went fairly smoothly. Her sister found out she was pregnant with her first child, little did I know I was on my way to
                        becoming an uncle. Soon after that Randi found herself in an awkward housing situation and we decided that she should move in with me. It was a little scary at first, we
                        had not been dating for very long, but she did it and we took that step forward together.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Shortly after moving in, Randi got a job as a flight attendant. She was going to travel the world! At this point I was faced with a very hard decision: I did not know if
                        I could handle a long distance relationship. She was to move in with her father and future stepmother in New York while I remained in Tennessee to go to school. After some time
                        to get used to it, it wasn't so bad. We made it work and we are stronger for it. Also, Randi got an incredible experience to see new places and live life a litte faster paced.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As time went on it was obvious that Randi was everything I would ever want or need in a woman and I decided it was time to ask her to marry me. We had been dating for several
                        years, lived together for a couple, and our dogs got along with each other. So I went out, bought the ring she had been eyeing online, and asked her father for permission. Once
                        we cleared up which daughter of his I would be asking, I took Randi to a concert.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When we arrived at the concert, I ran into a good friend of mine named Sam Barnes. He is a musician and can basically talk his way into anything. Working with him, we arranged
                        the band to play an acoustic version of our song. While our favorite song was playing, I got down onto one knee and proposed to my future wife!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We were engaged for one year, and married in August 2014 at the Wightman Chapel in Nashville, TN. We have since lived an amazing life with wonderful friends and countless good times.
                        As I told her on our wedding day, I cannot wait to spend the rest of my life with her. I am very excited for whatever life has in store for us.
